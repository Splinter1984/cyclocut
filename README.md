# cyclocut
Cyclone C utilities to easily deal with sending and receiving serialised data. In other terms, dealing with blobs of CDR (Common Data Representation).

**NOTE:** The current version of cyclocut works with cylone dds up to 0.7.0. Recently cyclone has changed its sertype/sertopic API and once stabilised we'll port cyclocut.
